# About Me
Hey! My name's Colin. I've always gone by he/him/his pronouns out of convenience, but I
don't really have a preference and am comfortable with anything. I write code and do general
IT related work for KPM Exceptional LLC. 

I love sarcasm, a lot. And I love pissing off pretentious morons. Also a lot. I'd say there's
a 50/50 chance you're here because you think I'm completely incompetent and are trying to find
some of my code to critique. If that's the case, you probably fall under the aforementioned 
"pretentious morons" category. Sorry! :)

On a more serious note, if you have an IQ above room temperature and are willing to have a reasonable,
well-tempered, and logical conversation, I'd be more than happy to.
