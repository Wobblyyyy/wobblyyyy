# about me
hey! my name's colin. i've always gone by he/him/his pronouns out of convenience, but i
don't really have a preference and am comfortable with anything. i write code and do general
IT related work for KPM Exceptional LLC. 

i love sarcasm, a lot. also, i love pissing off pretentious morons.
