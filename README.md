# About Me
Hey! I'm Colin, your favorite software engineer from nowhere other than Roxbury, New Jersey.
<!--
- 😄 My prefered pronouns are...
  - I prefer to use he/him/his pronouns.
  - I'm comfortable with any pronouns, including they/them/their and she/her/hers.
-->
- 🔭 My current projects include...
  - Pathfinder: A library using a pathfinding algorithim to generate paths for robots to follow on the fly.
  - elibsx: An incredibly expansive library for FIRST Robotics and Tech competitions/challenges.
  - AuthenticationM: An authentication management suite for Bukkit servers.
  - achat: An online chat platform, using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning...
  - Different pathfinding algorithms, including Dijkstra, A*, D*, and ThetaStar.
  - Computer vision using OpenCV - lane detection to be used on self-driving cars,
    object detection, recognition, and relative positioning.
  - Forwards and inverse kinematics for different types of vehicle drivetrains.
- 💬 Ask me about...
  - Robotics! I love robotics and have years of experience with both FRC and FTC teams.
  - JavaScript! I've written JavaScript frameworks, applications, servers, and everything in between.
  - Java! My favorite programming language at the moment.

## Projects
- 🛣️ __Pathfinder__
  Quickly find paths based on 2d coordinate points. Pathfinder allows you to utilize odometric
  positioning on a vehicle to (a) determine the vehicle's position, relative to an origin; (b)
  add a set of waypoints to follow, much like a trajectory; (c) find the most effective route
  to a position. In addition to supporting several different pathfinding algorithms, Pathfinder
  utilizes timed motion planning to give you the quickest route possible.
- 🤖 __elibsx__
  The largest and most expansive robotics libraries, designed to make development of robotics
  code significantly easier. In the spirit of FIRST, I've shared all of the core library code
  to help other teams develop their robots more quickly. By standardizing robot development
  between different challenges and competitions, programming has gotten a whole lot easier.
- 🔐 __AuthenticationM__
  An authentication suite for Bukkit servers. Password protection, user accounts, back-ups,
  hashing and encryption - all included features in this expansive authentication plugin.
- 💬 __achat__
  A Discord-like chat platform, accessible via a web client. Talk to your friends in group chats,
  servers, direct messages, and much more. Play games, such as Tic-Tac-Toe or Checkers, in
  group chats. Compete to win points and buy new cosmetics.
- 🖥️ __score.js__
  A jQuery-inspired JavaScript library. The days of writing long lines of code to change the
  text of an element are over - much of JavaScript's functionality has been extended and
  abstracted to make JavaScript development a breeze, no matter what you're working on.
- 🗳️ __politicalvalues__
  Much like the well-known Political Compass or the 8values test, politicalvalues attempts to
  assign some of your beliefs on different axes. politicalvalues is a simple and expandable
  quiz template project with the intention of characterizing a quiztaker's political views.

## Skills
A list of all of the skills I have, and what projects of mine demonstrate those skills.
- 🕸️ Web development with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. 
  (_achat_, _score.js_, _politicalvalues_)
- 🏭 Polymorphism and inheritence with object-oriented languages, such as Java.
  (_Pathfinder_, _elibsx_, _AuthenticationM_, _elibs2/3_)
- 🏦 Handling large sets of user accounts in a server environment.
  (_AuthenticationM_)
- 👀 Computer vision and different sorts of algorithms.
  (_elibsx_, _Pathfinder_)
  
## Documentation
In an effort to make my code clean and accessible to anyone who so desires, all of the
documentation for my projects is available in a select couple locations.
- 📘 JavaDocs (avaiable [here](https://github.com/Wobblyyyy/JavaDocs))
  SUN Microsystem's own form of documentation, JavaDocs detail methods, fields, and
  everything in between in an HTML form.
- 📗 Project Documentation (available [here](https://wobblyyyy.github.io/docs/))
  Documentation for all of my projects - how to use the APIs, how the code works, future
  improvements that need to be made, quick-start guides, and much more.
