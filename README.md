# About Me
Hey! My name's Colin. I've always gone by he/him/his pronouns out of convenience, but I
don't really have a preference and am comfortable with anything. I write code and do general
IT related work for KPM Exceptional LLC. 

I love sarcasm, a lot. Also, I love pissing off pretentious morons.
